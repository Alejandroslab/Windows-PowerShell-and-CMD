If you have a local account and you want to change the user name (the name that appears when log in in Windows)
You have to open Computer Management 

go to System Tools > Local users and Groups > Users

Select the user you want to change the name 
Click right > Properties 
On the General Tab under Full Name you can change the name 


Remember that the user name may not be the same as the user registered in the system (the one you see when open cmd)
