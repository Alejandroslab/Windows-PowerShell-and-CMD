Yes you can add permissions to the exe of the program. 
Go to the programs folder and look for the exe or as windows says the application. 
Right click on it and select properties. Go to the security tab and you will see the list of groups, system, administrators, users. 
Edit users and add the write , read, read & execute. This will allow for other users to use the program. 
You have to do all this as an Administrator. But not all programs are coded to be able to be used on any user rights other than an administrator though. 
If that doesn't work then that is more than likely the case and would only run under an admin account.
