This error regards the Windows Backup functionality that hangs stating this error code.

The error occurs when there is no space for the Shadow Copy

It happens when your System Reserved partitions has less than 50 mb of free space (available space)

The minimun and recommended space rules for your disks:
If Volume size    Then free space must be at least
<500MB	           50MB
>500MB	           320MB
>1GB	             1GB

You may need to clean the change journal although it could not be activated
to do that:
first assign the letter 'Q' to your System Reserved Partition
then open cmd with admin privileges and type

fsutil usn deletejournal /N /D Q:


After run it you should be able to run your backup


OTHERWISE:

You must extend the System Reserved partition

First shrink your main disk of about 100 mb (the max size the System Reserved must be 349 mb)

Then you must extend the System Reserved partition.

You cannot do that with Disk Management Widnows built-in funcionality

You must use a third party application. I have tested and use the Minitool Partition Wizard.

With that program you can extend the System Reserved Partition and use the new unallocated space
as extension

It will require to reboot the pc

Now open your cmd with admin privileges and type.

sfc /scannow

This will look for error and try to repair them

after that run:

DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

Once done proceed with these steps.
-Press Windows key + R
-Type Services.msc and hit enter.
-Look for Volume Shadow Copy service and Windows Backup
-Set them as Automatic.

Restart your computer

Now you should be able to run Windows Backup and create the system image
