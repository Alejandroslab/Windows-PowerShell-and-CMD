If I'm right, based on my knowledge, the files in channels are stored in SharePoint Online, and the private chat files are stored in the OneDrive Online.

And the storage limits is 2 GB for each user and 10 GB of shared storage across all teams. If you'd like to know how much of the personal space you have used, you can follow my steps to do that:

1.  In your Teams, click the Files in the left bar and select OneDrive, then click the Copy link > SharePoint and copy the URL.



2.  Open the URL in browser and sign in with your account.

Just select and paste the link until 'sharepoint.com'

Now you cannot know the total shared space occupied but you can know the occupied space per channel

Just click on any channel you desire then click on 'Documents'

Click on the yellow folder that will open up all the Teams attachment for that channel

Click on the 'i' information symbol on the top right corner 

Now just scroll down to the end of the column and you will find the size of that folder!

DONE
