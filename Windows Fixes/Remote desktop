In order to access to windows pc from windows first go to settings->system and
Remote Desktop

Enable remote desktop

Then discover the host name (in order to not have to remmeber the IP). Just  e.g.

Studio

(to discover your hostname open cmd and put 'hostname')


Open remote desktop connection on the pc that will control the other one

Insert the host name and click connect

In this case

Studio.local 		(after the hostname always put .local)

Now you have to insert your login credential of the pc that you want to control



WARNIGN! If you remember that you have change in the past your username than it could not work

You just have to put the old username and it will work!

REMEMBER also that the PIN is different than the password even if you have only a local account

Therefore you should type your password rather than your PIN and remember that they could differ.

If it does not work try rebootin your remote machine

if you still have sign in problems remember that your username coincides with your user in the path:

C:\\Users\MYUSER\

where 'MYUSER' is the user that you have to use in remote desktop to login even if you have changed
the username in control panel

then you can type your password

REMEMBER: remote desktop will not work if you don't type any password!
remember to set a password as leaving it blank will not make rdp work!
