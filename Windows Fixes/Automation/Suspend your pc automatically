Open task scheduler

In the Task Scheduler window, in the “Actions” pane, click “Create Task.”


On the “General” tab of the Create Task window, give the new task whatever name you want. We like putting a “z_” before any user-created tasks just so that they’re easier to find later with a quick alphabetical sort. Select both the “Run whether user is logged on or not” option and “Run with highest privileges” options. On the “Configure for” drop-down, select your version of Windows.


Next, switch to the “Triggers” tab. Click “New” to create a new trigger.


In the New Trigger window, make sure the “Begin the task” dropdown menu is set to “On a schedule.” Set up whatever schedule you like. Here, we’re going with every night at midnight. When you’re done setting up your schedule, click “OK.”


Back in the “Create Task” window, switch over to the “Actions” tab and click “New” to create a new action.



In the “New Action” window, set the “Action” drop-down menu to “Start a program.” Type “shutdown” into the “Program/script” box. In the “Add arguments (optional)” box, type “/S” to have have the task start a basic shutdown command—the same as if you’d clicked the Shut Down button yourself. If you want the command to also force any running applications to close without warning users, type “/S /F” into the “Parameters” box instead. When you’re done, click “OK.”
