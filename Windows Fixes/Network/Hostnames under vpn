hostnames will not work under vpn

you can set them in the host file in your client pc

Here’s how you can edit your hosts file without getting the “You don’t have permission to save in this location. Contact the administrator to obtain permission” error.
Hit the start menu or press the Windows key and start typing Notepad.
Right-click Notepad and choose Run as administrator.


In Notepad, click File then Open… In the File name field, paste the following path in:


c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\

Seleziona quindi il file 'hosts' (che non è un file con estensione .txt)

To map a domain, simply add a line based on the examples in the HOSTS file.
Start with the target IP address, then a space, then the domain name. If you want to block a website, redirect it to 127.0.0.1.
Don’t put in the # if you want it to take effect.
Also, remember that www.youtube.com is different than youtube.com.
You may need to restart your computer for the new HOSTS file to take effect.
