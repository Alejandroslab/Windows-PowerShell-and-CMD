Virtual local area network (VLAN) tagging requires that the network interface card (NIC) and the router or switch that you use support protocol IEEE 802.1q.

Depending on the NIC, you can set your VLAN ID in Device Manager.  Not all NICs that support VLAN tagging have this option.

    In Device Manager, open Network adapters.
    Right-click on the NIC and choose Properties.
    Click the Advanced tab.
    Scroll down to VLAN ID.
    Set the ID that you would like the NIC to have and click OK.
