If you cannot remove safely the disk as it states that
a process is still using it (like sihost.exe) then:


Open (cmd.exe).
Type diskpart.
Type "list disk"
Find your disk #, and type
select disk [here the number]

like

select disk 2

Now type:

offline disk

now you will be able to safely eject as usual from the task bar!

DONE!

REMEMBER! the next time you will plug the HD it will stay in
'offline' mode

therefore you have to do the same process but typing 'online'

another quickier way to turn it online is just open

diskmgmt.msc

(that is called 'Create partions..')

click right on the disk and select 'online'

now the HD will be available
