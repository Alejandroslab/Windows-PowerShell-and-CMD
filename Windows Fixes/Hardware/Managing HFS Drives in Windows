not that easy 

if you want to format the hd then you will discover that no tool is able to format an HFS drive in windows....


2 solutions

1 - disconnect the hard drive and format it in another way


2 - Plug in a Fedora live usb and then format the drive from ther with the pre installed app "disk mangement" or something simolar 

if you want to access data without formatting you must use Paragon software
if you want to convert it in NTFS preserving data is not straightforward
