You can try the following workaround:
Install Vitual Audio Cable https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm

ALL THIS SOFTWARE IS Free

these procedure will create a virtual cable
that will reroute your signal to multiple outputs devices.
it will also add a delay (for bluetooth devices)

1. play music
2. open radiodelay and set as input CABLE Output
(the driver is always WASAPI)
3. open audio router
click on route on your local device and point
the external bluetoot device. Click on 'Duplicate'
and send the signal also to CABLE input cable

4. Now reopen radiodelay and set the Delay
like 0,21 seconds
5. set as output device the internal speakers
and click Play or F5

this will sync music from both the devices

it works with everything except Groove music app (the windows default one)
