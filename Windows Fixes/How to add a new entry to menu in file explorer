[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.png\ShellNew]
"NullFile"=""



If you want to add a file as a template for the new item, use

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.html\ShellNew]
"FileName"="html.html"
and then place the file (html.html) in:

For your own profile: %Userprofile%\Templates
For all users: %Allusersprofile%\Templates
For the whole system: %Systemroot%\ShellNew
