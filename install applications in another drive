you can install applications in any drive you want

a convenient way to do that is to keep the same structure of "Program Files/.." 
and just change the drive letter to the drvie we want

this is useful when we are running out of spce but we want to install something more

just be careful if your software will look for external dependencies like Program Data etc it may not work well unless it will not automatically point to C drive for program data but that is not always true
