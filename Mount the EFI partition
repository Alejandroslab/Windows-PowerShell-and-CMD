The EFI partition is the partition where all the EFI entries are located (e.g. when you perform a dual boot os with linux you will find there the .efi files 
for the linux OS)

Open cmd as administrator

diskpart
list disk

(select the disk where you know the EFI is located)

select disk 0
list partition
select partition 1
assign letter=b
exit

you can also just use 'assign' without any letter. It will take the first drive letter available

Now in order to see the content in Windows Explorer:
kill the File Explorer process and start it with administrative privileges (remember that you have open cmd as administrator therefore you can run 
these commands):

taskkill /im explorer.exe /f
explorer.exe

Now go to file explorer and try to open the drive.

If you cannot for security reason you can use a workaround

open notepad.exe as administrator 

from there go to 'open' as you would need to open a file

From that windows you will be able to navigate the EFI partition. You can  open folders and also delete files

Finally you may want to unmount the EFI partition. You can do that performing these steps:

    Run diskpart.
    Enter list volume and press Enter.
    Find the volume you'd like to hide and memorize its number.
    Enter select volume [number] where [number] is the number you memorized.
    Enter remove and press Enter.

DONE!
