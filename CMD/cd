cd folder

to change directory

as in Unix like systems if you a folder with empty space in the title you should add the single quotes ''

cd 'folder with spaces'


like

cd 'C:\\Users\MY USERNAME\Documents'

as the path contains spaces, single quotes must be implemented

_________________________

on the contrary the correct symbol to manage spaces in titles is
"" and not the single quotes ''

therefore in cmd

cd 'folder with spaces'

will become

cd "folder with spaces"
