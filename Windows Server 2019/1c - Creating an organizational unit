An organizational unit is basically a folder in which you can place
computers and users

This is properly like a folder and there is no constraint on how many you can create.
You can also nest them like:

-Department
  -hr computers
  -hr users
  -marketing computers
  -marketing hr

  Inside any organizational unit you can place your users or computers (that you have added)

To create an Organizational Unit (OU) open 'Active Directory Users and Computers'
Click once on your Domain on the left panel

THen on the right panel, right click 'New' -> Organizational Unit
Type a name and click ok


  Remember to not place an organizational unit inside the folder 'Domain Controller' as the 'Domain Controller' or 'DC' is always the server and you can get confused
