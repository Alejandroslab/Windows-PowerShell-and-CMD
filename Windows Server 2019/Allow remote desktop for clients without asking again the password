You have to edit your Default Domain Policy or create a new one with the following:
Click right on Deafault Domain Policy

Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates: Policy Definitions > System > Credentials Delegation
- Allow delegating default credentials with NTLM-only server authentication

Click right and select 'Enabled' > Add servers to the list > Show > add TERMSRV/*

DONE! This will not ask again about a saved password in Remote Desktop for all the pc inside the Domain
