Windows Server 2019 comes in 3 different editions:

Essentials
Standard
Datacenter

Essentials allow to work only with up to 20 users

Standard and Datacenter work with the
CAL's that are 'Client Access License'

These are licenses that allows to user or Devices
to connect to you Windows Server Machine:

for the users there are: User CAL's
for the devices thrre are: Devices CAL's

this licences must be purchased separetely from the
Windows Server License.

There are also RDS User CAL's that are licenses that
allow users to connect with Remote Desktop

The user will be able to connect with their account
directly to the server!


Finally the difference between the standard version and the Datacenter one
are basically linked to some limits regarding virtual machines that
you can install in your server and that in the Datacenter edition do not exist

This will allow to create more vm's in the Datacenter edition (no limits) and set them
with specific tasks creating a sort of 'subservers' deployments (that is where
the name Datacenter comes from)
