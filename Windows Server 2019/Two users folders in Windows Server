There are several possible reasons why you have access to two folders in users in Windows Server. 
One reason is that you have logged on to the server with different credentials, such as a local account and a domain account. 
This will create two profiles, 
one with the format %username% and the other with the format %username%.%userdomain% or %username%.%computername%
