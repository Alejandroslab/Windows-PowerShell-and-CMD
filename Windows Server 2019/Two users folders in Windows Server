There are several possible reasons why you have access to two folders in users in Windows Server. 
One reason is that you have logged on to the server with different credentials, such as a local account and a domain account. 
This will create two profiles, 
one with the format %username% and the other with the format %username%.%userdomain% or %username%.%computername%

This will happen when you create a domain controller (promote the user to a domain controller) and then demote it 
and recreate a domain controller. 
This will result in the creation of 2 users in the windows C:\\Users\




To fix this issue, you may need to delete the duplicate or unwanted user folder, but make sure you back up any important files or settings before doing so.
You may also need to transfer or update the userâ€™s profile settings, such as desktop, favorites, documents, etc. 
You can use the User Profile Service or the User State Migration Tool to do this
