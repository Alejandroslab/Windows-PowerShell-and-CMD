The shutdown tracker is that feature that will need you to
explain why you are shutting down windows server

If you want to disable it you have to change it in your local
Group Policy:
Go to:
Computer Configuration->Administrative Templates->System.

Double-click on “Display Shutdown Event Tracker”.

We are going to be selecting “Disabled”, therefore the notification will not be displayed anymore when shutting down your computer. Click “Apply” and “OK” to close.
