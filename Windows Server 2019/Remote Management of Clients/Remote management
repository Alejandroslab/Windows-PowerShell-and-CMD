You can also manage remotely your client pc
Just click right on the computer and select 'Manage'

if there is an error stating that is impossible to manage because there is no authorization this means that Windows Firewall on your client is blocking the connection

To be sure that this is happening just try to ping your client IP

then disable the firewall only for the Domain. If it starts to work than you have to set some polices on your Firewall
