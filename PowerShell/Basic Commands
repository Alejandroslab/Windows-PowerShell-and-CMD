In PowerShell some commands are similar to linux
like ls, pwd etc..

more specifically powershell create alias to its own command

dir

or

ls

to list all the folders (ls will be linked to Get-ChildItem)

to clear the terminal just type

clear


in Powershell you will be able to copy and paste easily
with ctrl+a, ctrl+c, Ctrl+z as usual


________________
in cmd the 'ls' command is 'dir'

as in PowerShell even in cmd you will be able to use
keyboard shortcuts to copy paste etc

in cmd 'pwd' is 'cd' or 'chdir'
