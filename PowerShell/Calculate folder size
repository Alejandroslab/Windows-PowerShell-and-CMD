As in Powershell a lot of linux commands work you can use

$pwd to insert the current path as text

this will be useful in order to count files, folder and folder sizes



to calculate folder sizes:

Get-ChildItem $pwd -Recurse | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum

this will calculate all the size consdering even the subfolders (see recurse option)

to get the number of files:

Get-ChildItem $pwd -Recurse | Measure-Object


you can even omit pwd if you are working in the folder that you want to calculate the size
__________________________________

in this case i want to calculate the size of a folder with a lot of subfolders, exlcuding from the
computation two folders

first go to your folder with cd

then

Get-ChildItem -Exclude firstfolder, 'Second folder' -Directory | Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum

this code will sum all the sizes of the folder excluding 2 folders

Noe the piping '|'. First it excludes the folders then
it will do the recursive search without those folders
then it will finally perform the calculation.
