Get-ChildItem -Directory #List only directories
Get-ChildItem -File #List only files


if you want to list except one folder use the syntax

Get-ChildItem -Exclude thefolderyoudontwant -Directory

where thefolderyoudontwant is the name of the folder that will be excluded from listing

remember to put the name. do not use tab autocomplete as it will insert the path of
that directory and not the name and it will not work.

in the case the the folder you want has spaces in its name just put marks on it


Get-ChildItem -Exclude 'My Folder' -Directory


if you want to exlude more than one folder just use the comma ','

Get-ChildItem -Exclude thefolderyoudontwant, 'My Folder' -Directory
