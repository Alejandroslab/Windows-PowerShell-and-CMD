In Powershell you will use the same commands as in Linux

the difference is that you must indicate the right path whenever you want to upload files. Something like this:

put C:\Users\MyUSER\Desktop\myfile.txt

while using 'put' you can also use -v for verbose or -d for debuggin

to move a file you have to use 'rename' and not 'mv'

rename myfile.txt /myfolder/myfile.txt
