Get-Content C:\logs\log01012020.txt


You can also move all the content to a variable and use that variable for further processing if thatâ€™s something that you want your code to do.

$file_data = Get-Content C:\logs\log01012020.txt

$file_data | Select-Object -First 10

the first 10 lines of the content will be stored in the variable and not the entire content.
