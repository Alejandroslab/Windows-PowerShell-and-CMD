rm -r

works

but the official command is

Remove-Item
that has also the -Force option

with cloud folders it will not work

therefore the possibile workaround is first moving the file to a non clodu folder
and then delete it

doing:

Move-Item $CloudDrive\$subFolder $noncloudddrive

Remove-Item $noncloudddrive\$subFolder -Recurse -Force

something like this
