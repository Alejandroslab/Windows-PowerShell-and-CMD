first create your script

myscript.ps1

then create a new shortcut in which the command is:

powershell.exe -f [path]

or just:

powershell -f [path]

e.g.

powershell -f C:\Users\Myuser\Documents\myscript.ps1

finally after creating this shortuct click right and go to properties,
click on 'Advanced'
and check the 'Run as administrator' option

click ok

done!

now you will have to run just the shorcut that will invoke the script with elevated privileges
