Go to Settings -> Configuration -> General -> MobaXterm passwords management, and there is a radio button for "Choose where to save passwords." The two options are "User registry" and "Configuration file."

If you choose "Configuration file," the passwords will be saved, in some hashed or obscured form, in MyDocuments/MobaXterm/MobaXterm.ini.

This is likely not a safe way to secure your passwords, but it does answer your question. That's where the passwords are stored, anyway. How to extract them to plaintext is another question; I don't know the answer to that.
