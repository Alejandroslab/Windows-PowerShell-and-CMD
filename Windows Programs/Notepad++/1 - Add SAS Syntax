SAS syntax is not enabled by default you have to download an xml file from github:

https://github.com/cjdinger/sas-npp

This is referenced in the SAS official page

Then in Notepad++ go to Language>User Defined Language>Define Your Language

Click on import and import the Sas xml

Done!

The only downside is that you have to leave the default style (you cannot change the style to Solarized Dark :( )
because you will have some color problems
