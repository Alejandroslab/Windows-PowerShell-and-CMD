if you have full keyboard just press inside the vm:

ctrl + alt + end

otherwise if you have a mac you need to open the virtual keyboard (that you will find in start under 
Accessibility).
You can also run on 'Run' (shortcut win+r):

run this command:

osk 

now press phisycally ctrl + alt and click on the button 'end' on the virtual keyboard 

done!


this is useful when you have to change your password etc..
