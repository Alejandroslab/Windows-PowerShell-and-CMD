In Windows (command prompt) you can use CertUtil, here is the syntax:

CertUtil [Options] -hashfile InFile [HashAlgorithm]

for syntax explanation type in cmd:

CertUtil -hashfile -?

example:

 CertUtil -hashfile C:\myFile.txt MD5

or

certUtil -hashfile (name of file. drag your file here) SHA256

default is SHA1 it supports: MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512. Unfortunately no CRC32 as Unix shell does.
