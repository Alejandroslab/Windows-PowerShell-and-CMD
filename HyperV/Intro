HyperV is the windows type 1 hypervisor


It will create an enviroment in which a vm is installed and then a connection via rdp is provided all out of the box within the application

HyperV Manager can manage instances of the underlying HyperV service when is installed locally but can also manage instances of HyperV that are remotely installed (on a server)
