Basically a bridged connection is a connection that allow to connect the guest to the same network of the host

To do that open HyperV Manager then on the right you will find
Virtual Switch Manager

Theoretically we just have to create a Virtual Switch that will allow to redirect the traffic using an existing interface

to do that
click on 'New virtual network switch'
select 'External'
and click on 'Create'
Now just type in a name you want for the Virtual Swith and select the interface you want to use

Leave it everything as it is and click ok!

done

Now if you have already deployed a VM you can change in settings its switch
You can do that without having to reboot it

Just enable it in settings and done
