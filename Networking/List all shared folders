In my opinion, Computer Management is the best Windows tool for getting the complete list of shared folders on your PC. Open Computer Management and, on its left side panel, navigate to System Tools > Shared Folders > Shares. 
Then, in its central panel, Computer Management lists all the shared folders on your Windows computer or device.
