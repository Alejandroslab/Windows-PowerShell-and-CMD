Whenever you log in with Microsoft 365 credentials you will get the error:

"This microsoft account does not exist" or something similar 

This happens because you do not have a microsoft acount whenever you purchase a Microoft 365 Business license

This is involved with Azure 

With Microsoft 365 Business you will get a very basic Azure AD subscription thta will allow you to register devices but not to join PC 

So in order to be able to log in with you credentials you must create another microsoft free account
that can also be identifical to the Microsoft 365 Business account in term of email

Alternatively you should purchase an Azure AD (AAD) subscription
